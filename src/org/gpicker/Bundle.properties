OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    gpicker  is  a gtk+ program that allows you to quickly and conveniently \npick file in a (possibly very large) project. \
    You type significant \nletters  of file name (typically from the start of words) and gpicker \nprovides you with a list of files you most likely mean to pick. \
    The  \nprogram  filters  and  orders  project's list of files in real-time as \nyou type. \
    It prints selected item (or items in multi-select mode) on  \nstandard output.\n\n\
